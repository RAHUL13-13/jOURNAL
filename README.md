# Thanks for checking out the project!
## Getting Started - Register
Registering is simple, I believe.
Enter a username of at most 15 characters without spaces. Type in a password and confirm by typing it again.
Choose your profile visibility, which is by default public so people can search and see your entries. Check the box to make it private if you wish.
After that, click "Register". There, you're automatically logged in.

## Creating a Entry
After logging in, you will see the home page.
It shows you the number of entries you have. It also tells if you have created an entry today.
Go to 'New Entry' at the navigation bar. Two textboxes are shown, a small one for title, the other for the actual entry.
If you do not have a title, it will be replaced by '/'.
When you're done, click the create button and you will be redirected to Entries, where you can view and alter your previous entries.

## Entry Editing and Deleting
On the Entries page, a table shows all your entries' title and date with a view button and edit button.

### Viewing
Entries are sorted according to date. The sorting button can change the sorting order.
To view the entry, click the View button.

### Editing
After pressing 'view', the entry will be displayed with a blue edit button and red delete button. Click the edit button, and you will be taken to /edit.
It will be the same as you left it. Editing is similar to creating a new entry, but with a cancel button in case you decided not to make changes.

## Friends
You can search for a user and see their entries if they have their profile visibility as public.
Type the username into the search box and search.

### View
Click on the view button to see the list of entries of the user. It works the same as your own entries, but you cannot alter others' entries.

### Add
Click the Add button on the results list. Afterwards, the user appears under the search box for you to view easily.

## Search
You can search for content in your entries, similar to other searching functions.


## Account management
In My Account, you can change your username and password, as well as the profile visibility.
